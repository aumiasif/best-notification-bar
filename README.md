Best notification bar plugin for wordpress. Adds a static but hidable Notification bar at the top or bottom of the page. Where you can show stuffs.

Still a working progress, features those works now are as follows:

    Notification Bar Creation
    background color and text color change
    Notification Bar position (Top or Bottom)
    local visibility conditions (show on all pages & specific page, show on all posts or specific posts, show on homepage)
    working on referer conditions and multiple notification bar to show on different conditions

Updates will be released very soon.

== Installation ==
Install the plugin form WordPress's plugin repository or simply download it and upload it form add new plugin section from admin. Before doing anything, regenerate thumbnails. Cause this plugin uses a different thumbnail size. 

You will find a menu called BNB Settings, where you can change settings.
